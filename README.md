# gnss-sdr-rpi

This repository is designed to help users build and execute GNSS-SDR on a raspberry pi. Specifically GNSS-SDR that is meant to be run with a hack-rf one and with real time data.  This has been tested successfully on raspberry pi4 running raspbian buster and is in the midst of being tested on a raspberry pi zero. NOTE: This will not work for a raspberry pi running raspbian bullseye.
